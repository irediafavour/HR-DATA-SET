### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the provided HR dataset to understand employee demographics, job roles, job satisfaction, performance metrics, and attrition status. By examining these variables, the analysis aims to uncover patterns that contribute to employee turnover and retention.

### Data Source

2. Job Details: Information on departments, job roles, and job levels, allowing for segmentation by role and seniority.
3. Performance Metrics: Performance rating.
4. Satisfaction Metrics: Job satisfaction ratings
5. Attrition Information: Identifies whether an employee is a current or former employee, allowing for comparisons between those who have left and those who are still with the company.

### Project Objectives
The primary objective is to identify factors contributing to employee attrition by analyzing the relationship between job satisfaction, demographics, and career progression. 

### Tools Used
Power BI for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards

### Formula Used
1. Attrition rate = sum ('HR data' [Attrition Count]) / sum ('HR data' [Employee Count])
2. Average age = AVERAGE ('HR data' [age])
3. Use of conditional columns
